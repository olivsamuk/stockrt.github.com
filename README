These are the core files I use for making my personal page here at GitHub.

My projects' name and description are dynamically listed, and this is
somewhat cool.
You can copy the generation samples from here and use it to make your own
personal page for 'yournickname.github.com'.
If you are going to use my code, please keep the reference.

My page (the one that uses this files you have found here) is:
http://stockrt.github.com

I have made four different versions of my homepage:
- Dynamic, all external (JS/CSS) http://stockrt.github.com/tests/dynamic/external/index.html
- Dynamic, all embedded (JS/CSS) http://stockrt.github.com/tests/dynamic/embedded/index.html
- Static, all external (JS/CSS) http://stockrt.github.com/tests/static/external/index.html
- Static, all embedded (JS/CSS) http://stockrt.github.com/tests/static/embedded/index.html

If you try each one, you will probably see that the last one, static, all
embedded, is the fastest one. This is the one I picked for the official
page, http://stockrt.github.com

To maintain this static page updated (listing the newer repos I create, or
listing the updated descriptions, for instance) would require some work of
the 'webmaster' (me, you) and this is kinda boring. Because of that I made
this simple script called GPGEN. It does the same as the dynamic versions
of my page, but using a template engine and simplejson, to query GitHub API
of my updates, and then to generate my new index.html.
You can get this cool script here: http://github.com/stockrt/gpgen
