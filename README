These are the core files I use for making my personal page here at GitHub.

My projects' name and description are dynamically listed and sorted by
relevance, and this is somewhat cool.
You can copy the generation samples from here and use it to make your own
personal page for 'yournickname.github.com'.
If you are going to use my code, please keep the reference.

My page (the one that uses this files you have found here) is:
http://stockrt.github.com
