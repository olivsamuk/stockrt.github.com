These are the core files I use for my blog hosted on GitHub.

Since they do not provide any dynamic content generation engine (like
wordpress or any other php/ruby/python blog) I need to generate my blog
statically, so I use jekyll and my templates to do it.

You can find my blog/site templates here:
http://github.com/stockrt/stockrt.github.com/tree/master/site

To build your own, do the following:

    gem source -a http://gems.github.com
    gem source -a http://gems.rubyforge.org
    gem install mojombo-jekyll

    cd /tmp
    git clone git://github.com/stockrt/stockrt.github.com.git
    mkdir mysite
    mv stockrt.github.com/site mysite/
    cd mysite/site

    ./new_post.sh "A new post"
    vi _posts/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")-a-new-post.markdown
    ./build.sh

    # You may have some difficulty with other dependencies for jekyll, just
    # install them as you will be asked for.
    # See it for more help: http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/install

All you need to do is to make new posts using "./new_post.sh" and to
configure this set of templates with your own data in the file "_config.yml",
and then build you site with: "./build.sh".
