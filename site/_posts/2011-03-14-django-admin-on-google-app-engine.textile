h2. Django Admin on GAE

Did you ever wanted to run Django's Admin interface on Google's App Engine?
Now you can and we have made a live sample so you can clone, try and use it.

h2. Here is what you want to know

This is running thanks to the projects listed below:
"djangoappengine":app
"django-nonrel":nonrel

h2. The real thing, a live sample

"https://github.com/stockrt/djangoadminongae":sample
"http://djangoadminongae.appspot.com/admin":sampleonline

h2. Starting your fresh project

Here you can find a "djangoappengine bootstrap script":boot to start a fresh
project like this one but with the newest possible versions of all deps. The
same script was used to create this sample project.
